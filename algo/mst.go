/*
MSTKruskal implements Kruskal's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning forest
(tree if the graph is connected) of an undirected graph with weighted edges.

It is a greedy algorithm that applies the greedy-choice property by first
sorting all edges of the graph in order of non-decreasing edge weights, and
then iterating over the sorted list of edges, always picking the edge of
least weight (greedy choice, locally optimal) that connects previously
unlinked components. A disjoint-set data structure is used to keep track
of the components, and at the end of the algorithm, the list of edges
returned forms an MST of the original graph (globally optimal solution).

Expectations:
	- The graph is correctly built.
	- The graph is undirected.

Complexity:
	- Time:  O(E log V)
	- Space: Î˜(V + E).
